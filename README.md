# Parcel Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for web development projects using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a bundler and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor. I developed this project overtime while working with Parcel. It helped to get through a lot of [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/JuanMartinRivas/solutions). It includes some SCSS files which contain basic styles for your project as well as [Andy Bell's](https://gist.github.com/Asjas) [CSS reset](https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421). I hope you find this useful.
